# Artificial Intelligence JGEC Assignments

This repository contains assignments related to Artificial Intelligence algorithms. These assignments cover fundamental AI search algorithms with practical examples and Python code implementations.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: BFS and DFS Algorithms with Examples
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm that explores all the nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to be explored.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm that explores a branch of the graph as deep as possible before backtracking to explore other branches. DFS uses recursion or a stack for traversal.

Python implementations and examples are provided for both BFS and DFS.

### Assignment 2: A*, AO*, Greedy Search, and Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithms with Examples
- **A\* Search**: A pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path by considering both the cost from the start node (`g(n)`) and the estimated cost to the goal (`h(n)`), using a heuristic function.
- **AO\* Algorithm**: A graph search algorithm for AND-OR graphs. It solves problems by decomposing them into subproblems and recursively finding the solution.
- **Greedy Search**: A search algorithm that chooses the path that seems the best at each step, based only on the heuristic function, without considering the overall path cost.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the minimax algorithm in game theory. It "prunes" branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision, optimizing performance in decision-making problems.
